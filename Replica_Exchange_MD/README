             USAGE:  sh remd_setup.sh                            [ default runs with plumed ]
                     sh remd_setup.sh --without-plumed           [ Runs without Plumed i.e Uses only Gromacs ] 
             
             Requirements:  Plumed and Gromacs should be installed with mpi
                            gfortran, gnuplot
                          
             
             Description:  This script will generate required input files and run the remd simulation
             for alanine dipeptide in vacuum using gromacs and plumed (optional) for 2 ns.
             
             It will create following directories and stores related files in those directories:
             
             INITIAL_STRUCTURES:   Build the initial structures( gro & top) files
             MIN : write necessary input files and does the energy minimization.
             REMD: Prepare the input files for running REMD and Runs simulation for 2ns with 4 replica.
             ANALYSIS: This script also does basic analysis and stores the plots in this directory.
             
             
             Note: This script uses the geometric progression to generate the required temperatures. 
             
             
             
             
            ** More Details will be updated Soon.......!!!!
