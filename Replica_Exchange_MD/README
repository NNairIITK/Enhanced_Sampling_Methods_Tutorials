             USAGE:  sh remd_setup.sh
             
             Requirements:  Plumed and Gromacs should be instakked with mpi
                            gfortran, gnuplot
                          
             
             Description:  This script will generate required input files and run the remd simulation
             for alanine dipeptide in vacuum using gromacs and plumed (optional) for 2 ns.
             
             It will create following directories and stores related files in those directories:
             
             INITIAL_STRUCTURES:   Build the initial structures( gro & top) files
             MIN : Does small energy minimization run
             REMD: Prepare the input files for running REMD and Runs simulation for 2ns with 4 replica.
             ANALYSIS: This script also does basic analysis part.
             
             
             
            ** More Details will be updated Soon.......!!!!
